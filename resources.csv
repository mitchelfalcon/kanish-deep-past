"Gürsel, Haluk",1988,An Expert System for Cuneiform Interpretation,Middle-East Technical University METU (Master's thesis but listed here due to its pioneering nature),Sign query; transliteration,Hittite,Prolog; Expert Systems,,,[asahala has received PDF from Gürsel],"""Interpretation of cuneiform texts is a field which has not yet had its share of computer technology. Even in countries where computers are applied to almost every type of work, cuneiform handling is still a manual process peculiar to a few specialists. A major reason for this is the fact that computers and cumeifom as an ancient script are two completely different notions; the difficulty of representing cuneiform symbols in a computer environment has been the second reason. This thesis is about the expert system developed to transfrom an available Hittite cuneiform text into readable form. The expert system, developed in Prolog, first lets user define known cuneiform symbols. Later, the symbols are converted to their readable equivalents. This conversion is a task based on some complicated rules which are expressed in Prolog. The need of relatively expensive special I/O devices are thus eliminated by using such an approach.""

Parpola's Proto-Sumerian reconstructions and their alleged relation to Uralic languages, and (B) a critical analysis of S. Parpola's etymologies. Of the 2624 suggested etymologies, 73 featured regular sound correspondeces with at least one minimal pair and had an alleged cognate in both, West and East Uralic. However, taking into account several other uncertainties such as possible borrowings, questionable semantic relations and the vocabulary that is traditionally not reconstructed beyond Proto-Finnic (i.e. not into Uralic or even Permic), at least 45 of these etymologies have to be likely discarded. Although the remaining 28 etymologies show varying degree plausibility, the report concludes that the hypothesis of genealogical relationship between Uralic and Sumerian languages cannot be reliably confirmed on basis of the lexical evidence presented at the time using computational models. Nonetheless, the study shows that finite-state machines as concatenated rewrite rules are very useful for modeling and evaluating phonological change between various development stages of languages, whereas the parallelly applied TWOL rules are significantly more difficult to implement unless the languages are closely related.",,no,Descriptive notes,,

This problem is apparent in the corpora of the ancient Mesopotamian languages such as Sumerian and Akkadian. When word associations are measured, vocabulary from repetitive passages tends to dominate the top-ranks and conceal more interesting and descriptive use of the language. We propose an algorithmic way to reduce the impact of repetitiveness by weighting the co-occurrence probabilities by a factor based on their contextual similarity. We demonstrate that the proposed approach does not only effectively reduce the impact of distortion in repetitive corpora, but that it also slightly improves the performance of several PMI-based association measures in word relatedness tasks in non-repetitive corpora. Additionally, we propose normalization for PMI2, a commonly-used association measure, and show that the normalized variant can outperform the base measure in both, repetitive and non-repetitive corpora.",,yes (double blind),Research Paper,,
